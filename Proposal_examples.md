## Example 1: High-Quality Proposal (Low Risk)

```markdown
# Proposal: Integration of Cross-Chain Bridge for Monad Treasury Diversification

## Proposal ID
PROP-2026-0047

## Author
0x7a3B...4f2E (MonadBuilder.eth)

## Submission Date
2026-01-23

## Requested Amount
150,000 MONAD (approximately $450,000 USD)

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal requests funding to develop and deploy a secure cross-chain bridge 
connecting the Monad ecosystem to Ethereum and Arbitrum networks. The bridge will 
enable treasury diversification, reduce single-chain risk exposure, and unlock 
new DeFi opportunities for the DAO.

---

## Problem Statement

Currently, the DAO treasury holds 100% of assets on the Monad blockchain. This 
concentration creates several risks:

1. Single point of failure if Monad experiences network issues
2. Limited access to established DeFi protocols on other chains
3. Inability to capture yield opportunities across multiple ecosystems
4. Reduced liquidity options during market volatility

---

## Proposed Solution

### Phase 1: Architecture and Security Audit (Weeks 1-6)
- Design bridge architecture using industry-standard patterns
- Implement multi-signature validation with 5-of-7 threshold
- Complete security audit with Trail of Bits and OpenZeppelin
- Develop comprehensive test suite with 95% code coverage

### Phase 2: Development and Testing (Weeks 7-14)
- Smart contract development for Monad, Ethereum, and Arbitrum
- Integration with existing treasury management contracts
- Testnet deployment and community beta testing
- Bug bounty program launch with $50,000 allocation

### Phase 3: Mainnet Launch and Monitoring (Weeks 15-18)
- Gradual mainnet rollout with transaction limits
- Real-time monitoring dashboard deployment
- Community documentation and tutorials
- 24/7 incident response team activation

---

## Budget Breakdown

| Category | Amount (MONAD) | Percentage |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| Smart Contract Development | 60,000 | 40% |
| Security Audits | 45,000 | 30% |
| Bug Bounty Program | 20,000 | 13% |
| Infrastructure and Monitoring | 15,000 | 10% |
| Documentation and Support | 10,000 | 7% |
| **Total** | **150,000** | **100%** |

| Timeline delay | Medium | Medium | Buffer time, modular development |
| Cost overrun | Low | Medium | Fixed-price audit contracts |

---

## Success Metrics

1. Bridge deployed and operational within 18 weeks
2. Zero security incidents in first 6 months
3. Process at least $10M in cross-chain transactions
4. Achieve 99.9% uptime for bridge operations
5. Community satisfaction score above 4.5/5.0

---

## Governance and Reporting

- Bi-weekly progress reports to DAO forum
- Monthly town hall presentations
- Open-source codebase with public repository
- Final audit reports published on completion
- Quarterly performance reviews for 12 months post-launch

---

## Timeline

| Milestone | Date | Deliverable |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| M1 | Week 6 | Architecture complete, audit initiated |
| M2 | Week 10 | Core contracts deployed to testnet |
| M3 | Week 14 | Beta testing complete, audit finalized |
| M4 | Week 18 | Mainnet launch |

---

## Conclusion

This proposal presents a well-defined plan to enhance the DAO treasury capabilities 
through secure cross-chain infrastructure. The experienced team, comprehensive 
security measures, and transparent governance approach minimize risk while 
maximizing value for the community.

We respectfully request the DAO's approval and funding support.

## Example 2: Medium-Quality Proposal (Medium Risk - Requires Human Review)

```markdown
# Proposal: NFT Marketplace Development

## Proposal ID
PROP-2026-0048

## Author
0x9c2D...8a1F

## Submission Date
2026-01-23

## Requested Amount
80,000 MONAD

---

## Summary

We want to build an NFT marketplace for the Monad ecosystem. NFTs are very popular 
and we think this will bring more users to the platform.

---

## What We Will Build

- NFT minting functionality
- Buying and selling features
- Auction system
- User profiles

---

## Budget

- Development: 50,000 MONAD
- Marketing: 20,000 MONAD
- Other expenses: 10,000 MONAD

---

## Team

We are a team of 3 developers with experience in web development. We have built 
several websites and are now moving into blockchain development.

Lead Developer: John (5 years web development)
Designer: Sarah (3 years UI/UX)
Marketing: Mike (4 years digital marketing)

---

## Timeline

- Month 1-2: Development
- Month 3: Testing
- Month 4: Launch

---

## Why This Matters

NFT marketplaces are generating significant revenue on other chains. We believe 
Monad needs its own native marketplace to compete.

---

## Risks

We acknowledge there are risks but we are confident in our abilities.
